# Android-Studio-Java 


The code begins with package and import statements, importing necessary classes from the Android framework.

The class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity, which is a base class for activities on Android.

The code defines private member variables for various UI elements such as EditText, TextView, and Button.

The onCreate method is the entry point for the activity. It is called when the activity is being created.

Inside the onCreate method, the layout for the activity is set using setContentView method, which inflates the XML layout file (activity_main.xml in this case) to display the UI.

The findViewById method is used to find and assign references to the UI elements defined in the XML layout file to the corresponding member variables.

The mButtonAdd.setOnClickListener method sets an OnClickListener on the mButtonAdd button. This listener is triggered when the button is clicked.

Inside the onClick method of the OnClickListener, the code retrieves the values entered in the EditText fields, converts them from String to int using Integer.parseInt, and performs the addition.

The sum is then converted back to a String using String.valueOf and set as the text for the TextView (mTextViewResult).

In summary, this code sets up an activity with two EditText fields, a TextView to display the result, and a button. When the button is clicked, it retrieves the values entered in the EditText fields, adds them together, and displays the result in the TextView.
